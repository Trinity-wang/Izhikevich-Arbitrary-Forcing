# Izhikevich-Arbitrary-Forcing
Izhikevich spiking neuron model with forcing via arbitrary waveform generator in MATLAB. Useful as an educational resource for the study of periodic forcing, and/or as foundational code for more advanced, deeper studies of the Izhikevich spiking neuron model and forcing of spiking neuron models in general.

## Prerequisites

MATLAB R2006a or later is required to run this program.

## Running Simulation

### Setting Simulation Parameters

### Setting Izhikevich Neuron Model Parameters

### Setting Stimulus Parameters

Below is an example program output: An Izhikevich spiking neuron model with parameters for Inhibition-induced bursting and an underdamped sinusoid injection current with a 20-10 Hz frequency sweep and noise.

# Izhikevich-Arbitrary-Forcing
Izhikevich spiking neuron model with forcing via arbitrary waveform generator in MATLAB. Useful for the study of periodic forcing, and/or as foundational code for more advanced, deeper study of the Izhikevich spiking neuron model, and of spiking neuron models in general.
